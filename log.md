Current app has some contents to read. But there is nothing in the app which makes the users to go through atleast once a week. For the purpose we should plan on something to be published weekly. That made me to think about creating a notification section.
- Notifications / Important infos
     - Articles to read about disasters happening globaly. 
     - Surviving techniques.
     - publish weekly once
